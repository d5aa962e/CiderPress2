# Apple "Macintosh File System" (MFS) #

## Primary Sources ##

- _Inside Macintosh, Volume II (1985)_ -- chapter 4, esp. page II-119+ describes the structure
  of MFS.
- _Inside Macintosh, Volume IV_ (1986) -- page IV-89+ has some notes about 64K ROM features.
Apparently the 128K ROM is when HFS was introduced.  It also talks about version numbers on
files (and their lack of usefulness).
- page IV-105 indicates that FInfo was created for MFS-era Finder, while FXInfo was added
for HFS-era.

## General ##

MFS was introduced with the original Macintosh in 1984.  It was replaced with HFS in 1986, with
the launch of the Macintosh Plus.  Support for MFS was included in the operating system until
Mac OS 8.1.
