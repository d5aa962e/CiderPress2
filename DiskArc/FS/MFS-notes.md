# Apple "Macintosh File System" (MFS) #

## Primary Sources ##

- _Inside Macintosh, Volume II (1985)_ -- chapter 4, esp. page II-119+ describes the structure
  of MFS.

- _Inside Macintosh, Volume IV_ (1986) -- page IV-89+ has some notes about 64K ROM features.
Apparently the 128K ROM is when HFS was introduced.  It also talks about version numbers on
files (and their lack of usefulness).
- page IV-105 indicates that FInfo was created for MFS-era Finder, while FXInfo was added
for HFS-era.
