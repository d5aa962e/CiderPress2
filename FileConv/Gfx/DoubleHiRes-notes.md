## Format ##

Double hi-res graphics screens are generally stored as a 16KB file.  The first half holds the
main RAM portion, the second half holds the aux RAM portion.

The screen layout and color generation is described in great detail in Apple //e technote #3.

Summary: pixel data is byte-interleaved between main and auxilliary
8K pages.  Seven pixels of each byte contribute to the image; the high
bit of each byte is ignored.  The screen can be regarded as 560x192 in
black & white, or 140x192 with 16 colors per pixel.

The colors are from the same palette as the lo-res graphics colors.

The interference patterns caused by adjacent colors are extremely difficult to model accurately,
especially considering that RGB and composite outputs seem to be different.  A literal
translation that treats the screen as 140 pixels with 4-bit color values will be very different
from what real hardware displays.  A better approximation can be generated by emulating a sliding
4-bit window for 560 individual pixels.
