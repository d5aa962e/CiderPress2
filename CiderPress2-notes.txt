# CiderPress II - WPF GUI Release Notes #

(For the command-line tool, see "Manual-cp2.md".)

If you've used the original CiderPress, most of what CiderPress II does
will be familiar.  This is a quick bit of documentation about new behavior.
Proper documentation will be added later.

To start the program, double-click `CiderPress2.exe` in the download/install
directory.

The initial window has buttons for opening an existing file, creating a new
file, for the two files that were opened most recently (if any).

## Work Area ##

Once you've opened a file, the screen divides into four windows: a
hierarchical view of the file contents, a hierarchical view of the directory
structure, a file list / info panel, and the add/extract/import/export
options panel.  The latter can be hidden with a button at the bottom right.

### File Tree ###

The top-left window holds a hierarchical view of the open file.  For a
simple file archive this might only have one entry.  For a simple
disk image it will often have two: one for the disk image (WOZ, 2IMG,
etc.) and one for the filesystem (DOS, ProDOS, HFS).  If the disk has a
custom filesystem or nibble format, the filesystem entry won't appear.
If the disk image or archive contains other disk images or archives,
those may be added to the tree, depending on the settings.

The file tree view is populated based on the "Auto-Open Depth" setting:

 - Shallow: only open the top-level disk image or archive automatically.
 - Sub-Volume: descend into multi-partition disk images and ZIP archives.
 - Max: descend into everything until we hit bottom.

If you double-click on a disk image or file archive in the file list,
you will jump to that entry in the file tree.  If it wasn't already in
the tree, it will be added.

There is no double-click path to scan for hybrid disks and embedded volumes.
To open those, right-click on a filesystem entry and select the "Scan
for Sub-Volumes" menu item.

### Directory Tree ###

The bottom-left window holds a hierarchical view of the filesystem, if
it exists.  Only ProDOS and HFS disks will have more than one entry here.
Selecting a directory in the tree will select that in the file list.

### File List / Info Panel ###

The middle window holds the file list or information panel.  There are
three possible views:

 - Full-file directory list.  This is the default for file archives and
   non-hierarchical filesystems.
 - Single-directory list.  This is the default for hierarchical filesystems,
   and is not available for anything else.
 - Info panel.  This is the default for disk images and multi-partition
   layouts, which don't have files.

You can switch between the views with buttons on the toolbar.  Ctrl+I toggles
between the current file view and the info view.

The info panel changes based on what is selected:

 - Disk image: notes list, metadata list (WOZ and 2IMG).
 - Filesystem: notes list.
 - File archive: notes list.
 - Multi-partition layout: partition map.  Double-clicking on a map entry
   will select that entry in the file tree.
 - Partition header: nothing of value.

The "notes list" is a collection of messages generated while the structure
in question was being analyzed.  If an entry is shown in the file tree with
a warning or error icon, the cause of the problems will be reported here.  If
nothing remarkable was found, the list will not be present.

### Options Panel ###

Options that affect add, extract, import, and export, including drag &
drop operations.

The panel can be minimized by clicking the show/hide button.

## Add, Extract, Import, Export ##

There are four distinct operations for adding and extracting files:

 - Add: add a file to an archive without modification.  Attempt to restore
   file attributes from saved metadata.
 - Extract: extract a file from an archive without modification.  Attempt to
   preserve file attributes.
 - Import: add a file to an archive, converting its format.  For example,
   the end-of-line markers in a text file might be changed from CRLF to CR,
   or an Applesoft BASIC program could be converted from a text file to
   tokenized form.
 - Export: extract a file from an archive, converting it to something new.
   This could be a simple adjustment to a text file, or a conversion from
   Apple II hi-res to GIF or PNG.

Utilities such as NuLib2 and the original CiderPress blend the operations
together, which can lead to some ambiguous behavior.


# Drag & Drop, Copy & Paste #

There are two basic scenarios for drag & drop: in-app and inter-app.  Drag & drop within the
application can be used to move files from one directory to another in disk images with
hierarchical filesystems, such as ProDOS and HFS.  When files are dragged or copied out of the 
application, they can be dropped or pasted into a different copy of CiderPress, or in an unrelated
application such as Windows Explorer.

The clipboard and drag & drop handling are platform-specific features.

## Drag & Drop Within a Filesystem ##

When moving files within a disk directory hierarchy, all selected files are transferred to the
target directory.  If you select a variety of files from multiple directories, all of them
will be moved to the destination.  If you want to retain the directory structure, move a
directory instead of the files inside it.

Unlike inter-application copies, the behavior is not affected by whether the display is configured
to show all files or only a single directory.

Dragging a file to the directory it already lives in has no effect.

Files may be dropped in the file list or directory tree.  If dropped in the file list, the
application checks to see if they were dropped on a directory entry.  If so, that directory will
be used as the destination; if not, the directory that is currently selected in the directory tree
will be used.

The order in which files appear in a directory can be important, so an effort is made to
preserve the order of the files.  They will generally be moved in the order in which they appear
in the file list on screen.

Copy & paste within a file archive is not permitted, because it's not possible to read from an
entry while modifying the archive.  Copy & paste within a disk image is allowed, but attempting
to copy a file onto itself will fail.

## Drag / Copy Between Applications ##

Inter-application Drag and Copy operations can be initiated from the file list.  They two have
identical behavior behind the scenes: in both cases, a collection of "virtual" file references and
metadata is collected and provided to Windows.  The file data itself is not copied to the
clipboard.  Using virtual file streams improves performance when starting a drag or copy
operation, and allows files to be dragged or pasted directly into "foreign" applications, such as
Windows Explorer.

Data is read from the virtual streams at the time the files are dropped or pasted.  Because of
this, files copied onto the clipboard cannot be pasted after the source archive or disk image is
closed.  Similarly, files copied to the clipboard cannot be pasted if they are deleted from a
disk image or file archive after being copied.  This means you can't copy files between disk
images by opening the first image, copying the data, closing it, and then opening the second image
to do the paste.

The application has no ability to influence how Windows Explorer handles the clipboard data
prepared for "foreign" transfers, so the file data must be arranged in the clipboard in a way that
allows it to be written to Windows without further action.  This requires separating data and
resource forks into separate file entries, with filenames and file contents appropriate for Windows
and the currently-selected attribute preservation system (NAPS, AppleSingle, etc).

When dragging or copying between instances of CiderPress II, a different set of metadata and
virtual file streams is used.  These copy both forks and all file attributes.  Certain options,
such as "strip paths" and "use raw data", will change how the data is placed on the clipboard.

Files may be dropped into the file list or the directory tree, from a drag initiated from another
application instance or from Windows explorer.  If dropped in the file list, we check
to see if they were dropped on a directory.  If so, we use that directory as target; if not, we
use the current directory.  When pasting (with Edit > Paste or Ctrl+V), the directory currently
selected in the directory tree is always used as the destination.

The order in which files appear in a directory can be important, so an effort is made to
preserve the order when copying them.  However, directory entries need to come before any
entries that use them, to ensure that the appropriate hierarchy is established before trying
to create the files.

### Dragging in From Windows Explorer ###

Files dragged from a Windows Explorer window are presented to CiderPress II as a list of filenames.
This works like any other add/import operation.

The exception to this is when Windows Explorer is treating a ZIP archive as if it were part of
the filesystem.  In this case, the files are delivered as metadata and virtual file streams.
This mode of operation is not currently supported.

### Partial Pathname Handling ###

Suppose we have an HFS disk image with the following set of files:
```
  MyDocs
    AddressList.csv
    FavoriteThings.txt
    FancyText.doc
  MyPhotos
    Rocks.jpg
    Family.gif
    Vacation
      Snow.jpg
      Resort.gif
```
If we copy these to the clipboard, what should the filenames be set to?  Specifically, if the
file list is just showing the contents of the "Vacation" directory, and we copy "Snow.jpg",
should it get pasted in Windows Explorer as "Snow.jpg", or under a couple of directories as
"MyPhotos/Vacation/Snow.jpg"?

The expected result of pasting or dropping the files in a different window will depend on how the
files were being listed in CiderPress II.  If the application was only displaying the contents of
the "Vacation" directory, it would be reasonable to drop the file as "Snow.jpg".  However, if the
application was showing the full file list, then the user would expect the directory hierarchy to
be preserved because that's what's shown on screen.

This is independent of the "strip paths" option, which always removes all paths.  For example,
when viewing just the "MyPhotos" directory, extracting the "Vacation" folder should extract
"Vacation/Snow.jpg" and "Vacation/Resort.gif".  With full paths those would further be stored in a
"MyPhotos" folder, while with stripped paths it would just create "Snow.jpg" and "Resort.gif" in
the target folder.

The behavior in the single-folder view matches Windows Explorer drag & drop behavior, because
Explorer is effectively always showing a single folder.

Using the current view mode to set the behavior has one drawback: CiderPress II currently always
displays file archives in full-list mode.  While it's possible to fully strip the directories
with the "strip paths" option, it's not possible to specify a partial path hierarchy.  (This could
be resolved by synthesizing a directory hierarchy for file archives.)

It's worth noting that the "extract" feature works the same way: files extracted from the
single-directory view will be "rooted" in that directory, but files extracted from the full file
list will be extracted with their full paths.

When files are copied between instances of CiderPress II, the receiving application also has an
opportunity to strip paths from the incoming files.  (The "strip paths" option is configured
separately for add operations and extract operations.)

### DOS 3.x File Handling ###

There are two additional considerations when working with files on DOS disks: "raw" mode and
text file character conversion.

It's important to pay attention to the "raw files" setting when copying files from a DOS disk,
because it determines how the data will be formed on the clipboard.  It should generally be
enabled for DOS-to-DOS transfers and disabled for anything else.  Setting it on the receiving
side is not necessary, as the mode flag is passed along with the extended attribute data.

DOS text files have the high bit set on every character, while ProDOS and other filesystems store
text files with the high bit clear.  A conversion can optionally be applied when copying and
pasting files within or between instances of CiderPress II.  The conversion does not affect files
copied to or from other applications, such as Windows Explorer, but that can be accomplished using
the import/export text feature.  The conversion is only enabled when copying to a filesystem,
e.g. from DOS to ProDOS, ProDOS to DOS, or NuFX to DOS, but not DOS to NuFX.  The
"Convert DOS Text" option must be enabled in the application settings on the receiving side.

## Add/Extract vs. Import/Export ##

CiderPress II uses "add" and "extract" to preserve file contents, and "import" and "export" to
convert file contents.  Both modes are desirable when dragging and copying, so we need a way to
tell the application which mode to use.

A simple button on the toolbar determines whether "extract" or "export" mode will be used.
The behavior is otherwise the same as it would be if that menu command were chosen.  The various
options can be set in the options bar on the right side of the window.

If the export conversion mode is set to a specific type, rather than "best", then only the
items suited for conversion will be exported.

[ right-side options bar to be explained elsewhere ]

When transferring files between CiderPress II instances, the mode must be set to "extract".  If
the mode is set to "export", the "direct transfer" data will not be placed on the clipboard.
Attempting to paste exported data into CiderPress II will result an error message.

## Misc ##

Windows does not allow drag & drop operations between applications with different privilege
levels when UAC (User Access Control) is enabled.  Windows Explorer does not usually run as
administrator, so if you run CiderPress II with elevated privileges, e.g. to gain access to
physical media, you may not be able to drag files in and out.

If no archive is open in the application, dropping a file from Windows Explorer into the main
application window will cause CiderPress II to try to open that file.


# Other Notes #

It's possible to explore some ".iso" files with Windows Explorer.  Such files
may be opened (read-only) by the system process (pid 4) and presented as a
drive letter, which means they can be opened as read-only by other processes
but can't be opened read-write.  This can be verified with Process Explorer
(https://serverfault.com/a/1980/268812): run as administrator, then
Find > Find Handle or DLL, and enter a unique part of the filename.

Ejecting the virtual DVD will remove the restrictions on the file.
