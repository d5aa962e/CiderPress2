# SSI RDOS Disk Images #

These disk images were created by formatting a blank "game save" disk with
the SSI disk initialization function in three different games (Ringside Seat,
Battle of Shiloh, and Roadwar 2000).  The games were run in AppleWin.

The RDOS 3.3 save (from Roadwar 2000) uses standard 16-sector formatting, even
though the game disk does not.
