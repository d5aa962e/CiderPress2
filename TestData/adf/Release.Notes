GS-ShrinkIt Changes--GS-ShrinkIt v1.1System Disk 5.0.4 or later is now required.GSHK v1.1 can create self-extracting archives (SEA).  SEA files are12K larger than regular archives and can ONLY be extracted on a IIGS (ie,DO NOT give SEA files to people with IIe's or IIc's because SEA files areGS/OS applications: S16 files).GSHK v1.1 now has a resource fork.Optimized the unpack code a bit.  These are some minor tweeks that mightmake a few percent difference in speed (15-18%).  The same optimizations weredone to the SEA unpack code so making and unpacking some SEA archives isadvised.GSHK no longer delays immediately after reading a file when compressing inorder to calculate a CRC on the file.  The CRC is instead calculated as thedata is compressed.  This pause was very noticable if you'd pack a very large(>100K) file.GSHK v1.1 is now approximately 25-30% faster compressing than GSHK v1.0.6.This is entirely due to the ideas of Andy McFadden.  He has yet more ideasabout how to get GSHK to go faster, but I haven't had time to implement allof them.  In order to achieve the speedups I've had to rewrite large sectionsof the compression code.  One of the speedups includes a new hashingalgorithm.               GSHK v1.0.6     GSHK v1.1 Finder         0:48            0:33 Moria          2:10            1:36I resegmented another large chunk of GSHK so that the unzoo, unarc, unstuff,usq, and uncompress segments share a single segment.  This saves some memory,reduces the load time slightly, and saves some disk space.Added a call to HandleDiskInsert to GSHK's main event loop.  You can justinsert an unformatted disk and GSHK will do the right thing.GSHK no longer makes the "operation complete" sound under System 6.0 ifyou cancel extracting or if something goes wrong with extracting.If you click the <Update> button and GSHK is unable to write the commentback to the disk the Update button will not be dimmed.GSHK can now open Binary II files inside of MacBinary files.In the "shrink to" dialog, if the name supplied ends with a period andone of the checkboxes is checked which causes GSHK to change or add a suffix,GSHK will no longer add a second period to the archive name. (ie, you'll nolonger end up with "Archive..SHK" if you started with "Archive.").When pasting text into the comment area, the <Update> button undims (Jon!).Added additional information on Apple-clicking to the prompt when askingwhat files to archive, delete, or add to an archive.GSHK can now open NuFX archives which are enclosed within MacBinary files.Added a new preference, "Display warning dialogs" which enables or disablesshowing the preceding dialogs.Added a dialog before making a disk archive which explains what it is, whyyou would want to make one and why you -wouldn't- want to make one.  This isto help out the online services a bit and try to make people -think- beforepacking the entire disk.When creating a file archive if the user has selected "Add Binary II tothis..." I added a dialog which tells the user that their communicationsprogram normally adds Binary II, not GSHK.  This is to lessen the number ofuploads to online services which are double-BNY'd (ie, one Binary II headeradded by GSHK and then another by the user's comm program).  Clicking<Cancel> only backs you up a single level so that you can either uncheck"Add Binary II" and/or rename the archive.Added a confirmation dialog before actually deleting files.Added a confirmation dialog before actually deleting items from an archive.Added a confirmation dialog before sorting an archive.Changed the text for the prompt for GSHK & SEA when extracting to say "Extractthe (enclosed) files ("blah" etc.) where?" instead of "Put the files...""Extract" better describes what's actually going to happen.Fixed a problem where archiving from an AppleShare volume resulted in archiveswhich GSHK and ShrinkIt thought were damaged.GSHK now strips the high bits off of names of old-style shrinkit disk archives(archives which were made with Shrinkit 2.1 and earlier have the high bits setin the disk names).If you get a CRC error, something should actually be displayed (the dialog routine was trying to read a non-existent resource).Added filename of current filename being extracted to the prompt string.  Ifyou've got "Prompt on every extraction" on, this is a crude way to find outwhat files are actually in the SEA file.Added "Prompt on every extraction" to SEA wrapper and GSHK core.  This allowsyou to prompt for a few files and then turn the prompting off rather thanalways have prompting on or always off.  I removed the "Prompt on everyextraction" popup menu from GSHK's preferences dialog.  I hope this is a trendas that dialog is -way- overloaded.You can now set "Add Comment to: No Files" and when archiving or adding, GSHKwon't add comments.  This is useful to make sure that no space is wasted whenmaking SEAs.Changed routines which deal with dates to use the 5.0.3 (and later) toolboxcall ConvSeconds which does date/time conversion to various formats.  Thissaves a few K in the main segment (and leaves me with less code to actuallymaintain). The time format is the same time format as in the control panel.Dave and I converted the GSHK source code to MPW IIGS in one (grueling) weekend(5/10/92).
