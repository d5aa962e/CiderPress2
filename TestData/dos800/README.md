The sample images were created by formatting a bootable 3.5" disk image in an
emulator, using the appropriate software.  The first volume has a "HELLO"
program, the second has the same program called "HELLO2".

To access the second volume after booting the disk, specify the drive number,
e.g. "CATALOG,D2" (OzDOS) or "CATALOG,D3" (AmDOS/UniDOS).
